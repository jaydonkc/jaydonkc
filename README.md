# ğŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Jaydon Chen

I'm a Computer Science student at Cal Poly SLO with an interest in using technology to solve meaningful problems.

ğŸ”¬ I believe that biology is rapidly becoming an engineering problem, and I'm exploring how tools like AI, data science, and bioinformatics can change medicine and human health.
ğŸ¤¯ Fun fact: I have never eaten a Cheeto
